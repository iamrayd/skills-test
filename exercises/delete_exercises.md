# Delete (remove) Exercises

Start with the BST built by inserting `7, 3, 9, 1, 5, 8, 10, 5, 5`.

1) Remove **7**. Show the inorder and draw the tree.
2) Remove **5** twice. After each step, show the inorder and whether **search(5)** is True.
3) Insert `6, 6, 6`, then remove `6` twice. Show inorder and `search(6)` after each removal.
