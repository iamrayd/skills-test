# Traversal Exercises

1) For the BST you built in `bst_exercises.md` #1, list the queue contents during **level-order**.

2) Given:
   - Inorder: `1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14`
   - Preorder: `8, 3, 1, 6, 4, 7, 10, 14, 13`
   Reconstruct the tree and give the **postorder**.

3) If you insert keys **in strictly ascending order** into an initially empty BST of size `n`, 
   what is the time complexity of inorder traversal? Explain.
